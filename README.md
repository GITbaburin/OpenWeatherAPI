# OpenWeatherAPI
Weather at your current location
This is a small program which detects your current location and retreives the weather with an API to OpenWeather

You can create a free OpenWeather account here and then you can add your API key to the config file:
openweathermap.org

IMPORTANT
Never save your API keys locally in your code as a string for real production code! But because this is a free account for a small program now it is okay.
